Who we are
BIGFILEBOX LIMITED (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a limited company registered in England and Wales (registration number 14086266) 93 Tabernacle Street,London, EC2A 4BA,United Kingdom.

We operate a single service BigFilebox. This privacy policy covers how we will use, collect and process any data provided to us.

How we process your data
Throughout your interactions with us we will collect only the data that we require in order to provide you with the service that you are requesting. The key information that we process is shown below for your information:

IP Addresses
When you access any of our services we will store a record of your IP address along with details of your request in our logs. This information is stored and used by our system team to ensure the integrity of our services. Retention: This information is stored in rotating logs, which are kept for a minimum of 6 months.

Authorisation and session data
Whenever you login to one of our services we will use cookies that will identify your session to our services. This is necessary to provide our service to you.

In addition to these cookies, we also store IP addresses and browser user agents with your session. This allows us to look for anomalies in its use to help us protect your account and our systems.

This data is stored until such time as the associated user account is deleted.

Your name
When you sign up, we need to know your first and last name so that you can be identified. We will use your name to address you and it may be stored in various systems that you use (for example: our helpdesk). This is necessary to provide our service to you.

Your name may be shared with other people that share access to an account you are part of. For example, if you have a BigFilebox account, your name will be shared with other members of that account.

Your name will be retained until your user account is deleted. In some cases, your name may be kept with your billing records where we have a legal obligation to store this information.

Email addresses
We will store your email address for the purposes of managing your account with us. This will be used for transactional emails that relate directly to your account or services. This information is required in order to ensure you are informed about your account and can take appropriate actions in various situations.

We may also use your email address to send you messages about our services which may include notifications about newly launched features, improvements to the service, upcoming maintenance as well as ways to help you make the most of your service. If you would rather not receive these messages, please let us know or click the unsubscribe link in these emails.

We will not send you any other marketing messages unless you subscribe to our newsletter which you can do through our website when signing up or through one of our applications. When you do this, you will be consenting with us to use your email address for this purpose.

You may withdraw this consent at any time by unsubscribing from the messages or contacting us.

If you are using a service that allows multiple users to have access to the same account, your email address may be shared with the other users on this account.

Your email address will be kept until such time as all accounts associated with it are deleted from our systems.

We do not store full payment card details on our own servers. We work with external PCI-compliant payment processors (Stripe and GoCardless) who store these details.

We also store the country that the card was registered in and the IP address country that the card was added from as a legal obligation to ensure that the correct VAT rate is charged for your payments.

We will instruct our payment processors to delete any stored card details when you cancel your account.

You will remain the data controller for all such data that is stored within our systems and are responsible for ensuring you have an appropriate lawful basis and notices in place to allow us to store this data on your behalf.
